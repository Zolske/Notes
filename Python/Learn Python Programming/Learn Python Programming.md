## Objects

> "Objects are Python's abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects."

An **object** is an abstract data type, it can include multiple **properties** and **methods** and may even contain other objects.

- **properties**: are the characteristics of an object, it stores all the data needed in order to use an object (*e.g. name, age, ...*)
- **methods**: are things that an object can do (*e.g. walk, talk, ...*)

Every object has an **ID** (*identity*), a **type**, and a **value**.

- **ID**:
  - the ID of an object is unique and can never be changed once it is created
  -  it's used behind the scenes by Python to retrieve the object when we want to use it
  -  
- **type**:
  - the type of an object can never be changed once it is created
  - the type states what operations are supported by the object and the possible values that can be assigned to it
- **value**:
  - if the value can be changed then the object is **mutable** otherwise it is **immutable**
